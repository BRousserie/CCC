Cinquante Centim√®tre Cube - My little Game Engine

I'm doing it by following TheChernoProject's Game Engine series. You can find it here :

This is only for educational purposes.
For each video, if I feel like I can, I try to implement the feature by myself before watching his solution -however, I had never used OpenGL, glm, ImGui or any equivalent before this project, thus I must sometimes "watch and learn"-. 
Either way, I always use his solution in the end because, 1st, he has already worked on several engines -including Frostbite Engine- while I have never made one, and 2nd, having the exact same codebase makes it easier to follow and implement each feature without spending hours refactoring because I didn't plan the implementation of future features.

I'll surely make my own Game Engine without guide in a couple of months, but I feel like I learn a lot by doing it this way so I'll stick to it for now.
